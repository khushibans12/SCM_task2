  <h1>MAKE MAKE-AHEAD INSTANT OATMEAL JARS</h1>
  <p>There are a LOT of things we love about prepping these Instant Oat Jars for a quick breakfast option, but at the top of the list is NO refined sugar! <P>

  </P>Don't get it twisted, you can make these guys as sweet as you like - but you are in control!

    <P>
    </P>Purchasing instant oatmeal cups or packages from the store with similar nutritional profiles to these jars is EXPENSIVE. </p>
    <P>Quaker Oat Packets (while delicious) contain too many unknown ingredients and don't allow control of added sugar. </P>
      <P></P>Brands like Purely Elizabeth, which use ingredients similar to this recipe, can cost upwards of $3.00 per serving.</P><P> These oat jars use high-quality, shelf-stable ingredients that can be bought in bulk (aka ... lower price), customized just for your family (use what you like and skip what you don't), and then assembled up to 3 months before eating.</P> To serve, simply add boiling water to the pre-measured ingredients and stir. <P>

    </P>Breakfast is ready!

  <h1>CAULIFLOWER-CRUSTED SPINACH FETA PIE</h1>
  <P>>For the crust

  Preheat the oven to 400°F (200ºC), and coat a a deep, 9-inch pie pan with cooking spray, reserve. Spread a clean tea towel on the counter for draining the cauliflower.</P>
  
 <P> Place the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and heat 5 minutes on high. The cauliflower should be tender. Transfer half of the cauliflower to a food processor and process mincing finely.</P>
 <P> Dump the cauliflower on the clean tea towel, and repeat with the remaining cauliflower. Use a spatula to spread the cauliflower in a loose layer over the tea towel and let cool for 10 minutes.</P>
  
 <P> While it cools, whisk the 2 egg whites with the parmesan in a medium bowl. When the cauliflower has cooled, pull up the edges of the towel and make a bundle, and press and knead the cauliflower over the sink to remove as much water as possible.</P>
 <P>Wring and twist the towel to squeeze out all the moisture; it will take a few minutes. When nearly dry, transfer the cauliflower to the bowl with the egg whites and stir to mix. Spoon into the oiled pie pan and press down with the back of the spoon to form a crust, making a rim about half an inch above the edge of the pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes. The edge will be browned and the bottom will look dry.

  <h1>PEANUT BUTTER BREAKFAST COOKIES</h1>
  <p>Each cookie with chocolate chips is about 160 calories; without them they’re about 130.</p>
  <p> They pack over 4 grams of protein per cookie. Now, I know that 160 calories is a lot but how many cookies can you say have 4 grams of protein? Not very many, I’m sure!</p>

   <p>These would also be great for an after school snack. They’ll satisfy the kids’ requests for cookies, but keep them full until dinner.</p>
   <p> They’re slightly sweet but not overly so and are very satisfying.</p>
   <p>They’d even satisfy a sweet tooth after dinner without wrecking your diet.</p>
    
    
    <p>Peanut Butter Breakfast Cookies stack</p>
    
    <p>These are very crumbly when they come out of the oven. They’ll firm up as they cool so don’t remove them from the cookie sheets until they’ve completely cooled. They’re not a chewy regular cookie, they’re more like a cross between granola and those easy gluten-free peanut butter cookies in texture and taste.</p>
     Just wait until they’re cooled to move them, then they’ll stand up to holding.
